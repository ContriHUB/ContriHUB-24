# ContriHUB - 24

[ContriHUB](https://github.com/ContriHUB/ContriHUB-24/blob/main/README.md) is an open-source event organized in october, parallel to Hacktoberfest, where we are expecting to get more and more MNNITians involved in Open Source activities.

## How to run locally?

- [Install Python](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Python)
- Clone this repository
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ContriHUB/ContriHUB-24.git
  ```
- Create Virtual Environment
  ```
  python -m venv <env_name>
  ```
- Activate the environment
  - On Windows, run: `.\<env_name>\Scripts\activate`
  - On Linux/Mac, run: `source <env_name>/bin/activate`
- Install the dependencies
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Change directory to _ContriHUB-24_
  ```
  cd ContriHUB-24
  ```
- Create a **.env** file
  - In Windows, Right Click, Open Git Bash here, and run: `touch .env`
  - In Linux/Mac, run: `touch .env`
- Fill the contents of **.env** by following the format given in _sample_env_file.txt_
  - You can use [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16630719/11671368) to generate **SECRET_KEY**, otherwise just remove that from **.env** file and it should work fine.
  - You will need to create a [Github OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) in order to fill **SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_KEY** and **SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET** fields.
  - Put both _Homepage URL_ and _Authorization callback URL_ as `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
  - If you want to work on Email Sending Issue, you also need to fill you Email (GMail) in **EMAIL_HOST_USER** and your Email password in **EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD**. (_Now you know why you should never push .env file to remote_).
  - You will also need to **Allow Access to Less Secure Apps** in your GMail Account.
  - You can also create a new G-Mail account to avoid using your personal account.
- To apply the migrations run,
  ```
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
- Now to run the server, and visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
  ```
  python manage.py runserver
  ```
- To access admin panel, you need to be superuser. Follow [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-superuser-in-django/) link for instructions.

## Points to keep in mind

- SMTP protocol will not work with proxy. Kindly use mobile data while requesting an assignment/ submitting PR link/ testing out email functionality.
- Every python project will be following some linting rules - Flake8 in this case. Kindly run Flake8 tests before submitting your code.
  To install Flake8, run this command:
  ```
  python<version> -m pip install flake8
  ```
  To run Flake8 tests on a file, run this command:
  ```
  flake8 path/to/your_code/main.py #check particular file
  ```
  or for an entire repository, run this command:
  ```
  flake8 path/to/your_project/ #check the entire project repo
  ```
